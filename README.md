================

OS X Croatian keyboard layout resembling the PC Croatian layout as closely
as possible.

The layout is created using [Ukulele](http://scripts.sil.org/ukelele),
the free Unicode Keyboard Layout Editor.

To install:

    cp Croatian-awesome.* /Library/Keyboard\ Layouts/

So far I got most of the keys *I need* to be in their right places including:

 - often used programming keys like `<`, `>`, `[`, `]`, `{` and `}`
 - state modifiers like `alt` + `<number>`, `a` for inputing other international
   characters such as ä, á or à
 - I don't need to mention where ć, č, ž, š and đ are, right?

It's not a full clone yet. Feel free to improve!

Živjeli!
